# Tesla Model 3 PCS controller (US)

STM32F103 controller firmware for a Power Conversion System from a US Tesla
Model 3. The controller communicates over IPC CAN at 500 kbit/s, keeps DCDC
support active and emulates the US Type-1/NACS charge-port messages needed to
request AC charging without a physical charge port, proximity input or EVSE
pilot interface.

## Important safety notice

The PCS, HV battery and 220 V mains can cause fatal injury. This firmware is
not a safety controller. Use correctly rated fuses, isolation, interlocks,
precharge, hardware current limiting and an independent emergency disconnect.
Do not apply AC/HV until the logic-level outputs and power circuit have been
verified at the PCS connector.

## What was fixed

- Correct `0x264` AC-current decoding: the attached trace is 220 V, 0 A, 0 W,
  not 51 A.
- Correct US `0x2B2` power-request buffer and DLC handling.
- Correct `0x22A` DLC, support/charge mode and measured-HV packing.
- Correct post-2020 `0x23D` to the four-byte charge-status format required by
  the captured 32 A single-phase PCS; the old two-byte frame left `CP_MIA` set
  and coincided with an 8 A fallback.
- Removed the synthetic transmitted `0x2C4` that collided with PCS telemetry.
- Added consistent 16 A US port emulation using `0x13D`, `0x21D`, `0x23D` and
  `0x25D`.
- Added the runtime `CHGcurrentSetpointA` register (0...16 A), synchronized
  current-limit frames and an AC-voltage-based `0x2B2` power request.
- Added automatic start after stable AC is confirmed by the PCS.
- Added CAN/HV/AC/PCS fault states and `0x424` alert diagnostics.
- Added host-side protocol regression tests and a portable ARM Makefile.

The original capture reports `0x204 = 78 00 00 FF 00 00 00 09`, which decodes
as charger main state 8 and HV charge status 3: both are `faulted`. A full safe
PCS power-cycle is required before testing the corrected firmware.

## Build and test

```sh
make test
make -j4
```

Generated release files:

- `build/tesla_charger.bin`
- `build/tesla_charger.elf`
- `build/tesla_charger.map`

Verified size (`text=44,544`, `data=128`, `bss=3,464`):

## Flashing the correct image

The tracked STM32CubeIDE launch configuration downloads
`build/tesla_charger.elf`. It intentionally does not rebuild before launch, so
run `make test && make -j4` first. Do not select `Debug/Tesla Charger.elf`:
`Debug/` is an ignored CubeIDE output directory and may contain an older local
firmware image.

When flashing the BIN directly, use `build/tesla_charger.bin` at address
`0x08000000` and enable post-write verification. The current firmware is easy
to identify without trusting the file name:

- the display contains `I set/PCS=`;
- CAN `0x22A` has DLC 8 and starts with `00 0B`;
- CAN `0x2B2` has DLC 5 for the current tested PCS configuration.
